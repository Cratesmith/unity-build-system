Unity Build System
==================

Goal
====

Provide an Editor Extension which allows adding multiple build targets and batch building all, one or a subset of these targets. 

Each target corresponds to a unity deploy plattform and should allow adding custom scripts to the build process to pre- and post-process the build. 

The resulting project will be made available in the unity asset store.
